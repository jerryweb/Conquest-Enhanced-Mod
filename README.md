- Replaced the default unit spawn with a new spawn wave system. This means that the AI will no longer just send in a random cluster of units, but instead mimic the flow of how real battles would take place such as: recon wave of inf and light veh, then the mortar wave to soften up positions, and then the tank assault.

-  Tanks will also move at the speed of the surrounding infantry to maximize combat effectiveness
