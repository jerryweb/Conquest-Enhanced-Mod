msgid "This mod a lot of things, make sure you learn about them.\n
You need an ARMORED command vehicle (with officer portrait), to have enemies on the minimap. AI now has emplacements on points.\n When you research defense levels you get infantry and emplacements on points along with ammo drops on level 3.\n There is a special command wheel (N) with QoL commands. AI now has a special unit that can call in off-map support, he shoots flares so make sure you kill him before he can call in any support.\n All AI can salvage vacant vehicles, emplacements. You cannot salvage enemy on point emplacements, arty and rocket artillery. If you have any more questions ask them in discord linked in the mod description."
